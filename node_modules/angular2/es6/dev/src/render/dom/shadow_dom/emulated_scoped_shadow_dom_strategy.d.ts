/**
 * This strategy emulates the Shadow DOM for the templates, styles **included**:
 * - components templates are added as children of their component element,
 * - both the template and the styles are modified so that styles are scoped to the component
 *   they belong to,
 * - styles are moved from the templates to the styleHost (i.e. the document head).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - styles are scoped to their component and will apply only to it,
 * - a common subset of shadow DOM selectors are supported,
 * - see `ShadowCss` for more information and limitations.
