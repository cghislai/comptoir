/**
 * Performs http requests using `XMLHttpRequest` as the default backend.
 *
 * `Http` is available as an injectable class, with methods to perform http requests. Calling
 * `request` returns an {@link EventEmitter} which will emit a single {@link Response} when a
 * response is received.
 *
 *
 * ## Breaking Change
 *
 * Previously, methods of `Http` would return an RxJS Observable directly. For now,
 * the `toRx()` method of {@link EventEmitter} needs to be called in order to get the RxJS
 * Subject. `EventEmitter` does not provide combinators like `map`, and has different semantics for
 * subscribing/observing. This is temporary; the result of all `Http` method calls will be either an
 * Observable
 * or Dart Stream when [issue #2794](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/2794) is resolved.
 *
 * #Example
 *
 * ```
 * import {Http, httpInjectables} from 'angular2/http';
 * @Component({selector: 'http-app', viewInjector: [httpInjectables]})
 * @View({templateUrl: 'people.html'})
 * class PeopleComponent {
 *   constructor(http: Http) {
 *     http.get('people.json')
 *       //Get the RxJS Subject
 *       .toRx()
 *       // Call map on the response observable to get the parsed people object
 *       .map(res => res.json())
 *       // Subscribe to the observable to get the parsed people object and attach it to the
 *       // component
 *       .subscribe(people => this.people = people);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To use the {@link EventEmitter} returned by `Http`, simply pass a generator (See "interface
 *Generator" in the Async Generator spec: https://github.com/jhusain/asyncgenerator) to the
 *`observer` method of the returned emitter, with optional methods of `next`, `throw`, and `return`.
 *
 * #Example
 *
 * ```
 * http.get('people.json').observer({next: (value) => this.people = people});
 * ```
 *
 * The default construct used to perform requests, `XMLHttpRequest`, is abstracted as a "Backend" (
 * {@link XHRBackend} in this case), which could be mocked with dependency injection by replacing
 * the {@link XHRBackend} binding, as in the following example:
 *
 * #Example
 *
 * ```
 * import {MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions, Http} from 'angular2/http';
 * var injector = Injector.resolveAndCreate([
 *   BaseRequestOptions,
 *   MockBackend,
 *   bind(Http).toFactory(
 *       function(backend, defaultOptions) {
 *         return new Http(backend, defaultOptions);
 *       },
 *       [MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions])
 * ]);
 * var http = injector.get(Http);
 * http.get('request-from-mock-backend.json').toRx().subscribe((res:Response) => doSomething(res));
 * ```
 *
