/**
 * A dependency injection container used for resolving dependencies.
 *
 * An `Injector` is a replacement for a `new` operator, which can automatically resolve the
 * constructor dependencies.
 * In typical use, application code asks for the dependencies in the constructor and they are
 * resolved by the `Injector`.
 *
 * ## Example:
 *
 * Suppose that we want to inject an `Engine` into class `Car`, we would define it like this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * class Engine {
 * }
 *
 * class Car {
 *   constructor(@Inject(Engine) engine) {
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * Next we need to write the code that creates and instantiates the `Injector`. We then ask for the
 * `root` object, `Car`, so that the `Injector` can recursively build all of that object's
 *dependencies.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * main() {
 *   var injector = Injector.resolveAndCreate([Car, Engine]);
 *
 *   // Get a reference to the `root` object, which will recursively instantiate the tree.
 *   var car = injector.get(Car);
 * }
 * ```
 * Notice that we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
 * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.
